Algorithmic Error
Error: Key press wasn’t being given correct value
Solution: Used incorrect scan code
Difficulty: 30 minutes
Difficulty to Fix: 10-20 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Keyboard interrupts caused crashes
Solution: We were sending incorrect value to enable_irq
Difficulty: 30 minutes
Difficulty to Fix: 1 line

Ambiguity Error
Error: Program terminates when it should spin
Solution: Needed default handlers for handlers that weren’t filled yet. IDT wasn’t fully filled
Difficulty: 3 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 10 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: EOI wasn’t being called in keyboard handler
Solution: Keyboard handler wasn’t calling EOI signal
Difficulty: 1 hour
Difficulty to Fix: 1 line

Ambiguity Error
Error: RTC doesn’t flicker
Solution: PIC code had many errors, including not enabling the slave, having incorrect ports/data with outb functions, and not setting EOI correctly between master and slave
Difficulty: 3 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 20-30 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Keyboard inputs don’t display correctly
Solution: PIC code had many errors, including not enabling the slave, having incorrect ports/data with outb functions, and not setting EOI correctly between master and slave
Difficulty: 3 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 20-30 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: RTC flickers but then general protection occurs
Solution: Had extra cli/sti in our interrupt handlers
Difficulty: 3 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 2 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Using printf caused page fault
Solution: CLI/STI the printf
Difficulty: 15 minutes
Difficulty to Fix: 2 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Inputs such as shift, caps lock, and backspace always create a new line
Solution: Our case statements needed breaks because it would go through all the cases
Difficulty: 1 hour
Difficulty to Fix: 5-10 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Backspace moves cursor back one but doesn’t delete on screen but if pressed twice it moves cursor back again but deletes the character that was originally supposed to be deleted
Solution: We were setting the current character to null instead of the previous character so thats why we backspaced twice and the character would disappear 
Difficulty: 1.5 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 1 line

Algorithmic Error
Error: Page fault when backspacing if characters exceed one line
Solution: We were resetting to the left-most x position instead of right-most
Difficulty: 0.5 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 1 line

Algorithmic Error
Error: Page fault when backspacing if there was ever a new line character
Solution: Our x index was off by one when backspacing and we were not resetting our buffer by calling terminal_read
Difficulty: 1 hour
Difficulty to Fix: 2-3 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Noticed that dentry.filename wasn’t printing anything
Solution: Switched params in the str_copy call in read
Solution: 3-4 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 2-3 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Vertical scrolling doesn’t work with character overflow but works with enter
Solution: We needed to modify putc so that screen_y doesn’t increment past 24
Difficulty: 1.5 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 5-10 lines
Algorithmic Error
Error: Page fault error because of incorrect page_dir access
Solution: We were using the wrong address values
Difficulty: 1 hour
Difficulty to Fix: 5-10 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Infinite loop when doing read_data
Solution: Need to break out of loop if no more bytes to read
Difficulty: 15 minutes
Difficulty to Fix: 1 line

Algorithmic Error
Error: Cannot find bounds of current function in asm volatile in execute. Page fault at IRET: assembly linkage was wrong
Solution: Read and write handler were being passed null arguments
Difficulty: 6 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 10 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Read and write handlers keep repeating over and over
Solution: Needed to keep track of enter key in our keyboard functionality so that it only reads when pressed
Difficulty: 3 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 20 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Only first three letters being passed to execute handler
Solution: Our sys link was implemented incorrectly, reformatted and fixed it
Difficulty: 6 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 50 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: If we typed and reached the end of the line the current line would get overwritten instead of going to the next line
Solution: Because of the ece391os> auto print, we needed to reformat the dimensions for writing on the next line
Difficulty: 30 min
Difficulty to Fix: 2 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Our terminal_read was incorrectly reading a new line character if we reached max buffer size which would mean that it was reading it as a command
Solution:  Because of the ece391os> we needed to reconsider our buffer as well and what would be sent to terminal_read
Difficulty: 1 hour
Difficulty to Fix: 10 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Keyboard wasn’t vert scrolling correctly after calling shell
Solution: We put vert scroll in our enter functionality but realized that if a command prints lines then it needs to vert scroll regardless of if we press enter or not
Difficulty: 1 hour
Difficulty to Fix: 20 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Pingpong wasn’t working because we had cli/sti in our interrupts which wasn’t enabling our rtc status
Solution: Remove cli/sti
Difficulty: 20 min
Difficulty to Fix: 2 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Page faults on ‘ls’ and ‘testprint’ because halt still has bugs, fixed by fixing the base table entry formula
Solution: Paging was incorrect, used wrong memory sizes
Difficulty: 6 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 1-2 lines

Ambiguity Error
Error: Issue with halt where halt status would change randomly and because of that programs would exit normally 
Solution: Fixed by adding cli/sti
Difficulty: 2 hours
Difficulty to Fix: 2 lines

Algorithmic Error
Error: Get args isn’t working properly even though the write arguments are being passed in the buffer
Solution: Our read data was wrong because we were passing fd into file_read instead of the inode
Difficulty: 3 hours
